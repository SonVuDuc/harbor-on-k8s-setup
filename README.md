## 1. Introduction
Kubernetes is a system designed to manage applications built within containers across clustered environments. It handles the entire life cycle of a containerized application including deployment and scaling.

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that manages Docker containers in the form of a cluster. Along with the automated deployment and scaling of containers, it provides healing by automatically restarting failed containers and rescheduling them when their hosts die. This capability improves the applicationâ€™s availability.
